## Part 3: Using Shifty to become familiar with OpenShift


Continuing from part 2, and assuming you can access the application via the Route provided and are still logged into the CLI (Please go back to Part 2 if you need to do any of those) lets become familiar with this application.  As stated earlier this application will allow you to "push the buttons" of OpenShift and see how it works.

**Step 1:** Familiarization with the Application UI
  1. Shows the pod name that served your browser the page.
  2. Left Menu: Home - The main page of the applicaiton where you can perform some of the functions listed<br>
    - Enter a message here to send a log message to the *stdout* stream
    - Enter a message here to send a log message to the *stderr* stream
  3. blahblah
