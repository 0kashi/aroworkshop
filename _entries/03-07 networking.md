## Part 3: Using Shifty to become familiar with OpenShift (continued)

### Intra-cluster networking
In this section well take a look at how Shifty can be configured using [ConfigMaps](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/configmaps.html), [Secrets](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/secrets.html), and [Environment Variables](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/environment_variables.html).  This section won't go into details explaining each, but show you how they are exposed to the application.  Click the links above if you want to find out more about each or you can also go to the Kubernetes documentation.
