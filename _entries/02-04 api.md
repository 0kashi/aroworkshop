The `rating-api` is a NodeJS application that connects to mongoDB to retrieve and rate items. Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

- `rating-api` on GitHub: <https://github.com/microsoft/rating-api>
- The container exposes port 8080
- MongoDB connection is configured using an environment variable called `MONGODB_URI`

### Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-api`

> **Note** You're going to be using [source-to-image (S2I)](#source-to-image-s2i) as a build strategy.

```sh
./oc new-app https://github.com/microsoft/rating-api
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Configure the required environment variables

{% collapsible %}

Create the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable. This URI should look like `mongodb://[username]:[password]@[endpoint]:27017/ratingsdb`. You'll need to replace the `[usernaame]` and `[password]` with the ones you used when creating the database. You'll also need to replace the `[endpoint]` with the hostname acquired in the previous step

Hit **Save** when done.

### Verify that the service is running

{% collapsible %}

If you navigate to the logs of the `rating-api` deployment, you should see a log message confirming the code can successfully connect to the mongoDB.

{% endcollapsible %}

### Retrieve `rating-api` service hostname

{% collapsible %}

Find the `rating-api` service.

```sh
./oc get svc rating-api
```

The service will be accessible at the following DNS name over port 8080: `rating-api.workshop.svc.cluster.local:8080` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`. This resolves only within the cluster.
